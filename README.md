# Monster Mash: New Sketch-Based Modeling and Animation Tool

This is the open-source version of Monster Mash.

Monster Mash is a new sketch-based modeling and animation tool that allows you to quickly sketch a character, inflate it into 3D, and promptly animate it. You can perform all interactions in the sketching plane. No 3D manipulation is required.bbb

The source code and web demo (http://MonsterMash.zone) accompanies a paper **Dvorožňák et al.: Monster Mash: A Single-View Approach to Casual 3D Modeling and Animation** published in ACM Transactions on Graphics 39(6):214 and presented at SIGGRAPH Asia 2020 conference.

Before compiling the project, please download the source code of the library and place it in the third_party/triangle directory. Please check the license of the Triangle library before doing so.
